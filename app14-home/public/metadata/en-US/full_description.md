#### Carousel
#### This extension brings a Carousel for your store.

When you install the app, you will have the following features:

- Define the numbers of Banners that will be displayed.
- Active autoplay mode and set the time (in seconds) to each transition.
- Define a call to action. It can be an internal route to the store or an external link.
